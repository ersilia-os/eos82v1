Title: SMILES-based Transformer Encoder-Decoder
Description: SMILES-based Transformer Encoder-Decoder (SMILES-TED) is an 
  encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a curated dataset of 91 million SMILES 
  samples sourced from PubChem, equivalent to 4 billion molecular tokens. 
  SMI-TED supports various complex tasks, including quantum property prediction,
  with two main variants (289 M and  8x289 M). SMI Ted has been developed by the
  IBM.
