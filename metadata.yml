Title: SMILES-based Transformer Encoder-Decoder
Description: "SMILES-based Transformer Encoder-Decoder (SMILES-TED) is an encoder-decoder\
  \ model pre-trained on a curated dataset of 91 million SMILES samples sourced from\
  \ PubChem, equivalent to 4 billion molecular tokens. SMI-TED supports various complex\
  \ tasks, including quantum property prediction, with two main variants ( 289 M \
  \ and  8 \xD7 289 M ). SMI Ted has been developed by the IBM"
